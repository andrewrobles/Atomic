\f0\fs44 \cf0 Once we have signed in using firebase, we have a uid that we have access to. We can use this uid to create a new user if it does not exist in the database. If it does exist in the database, then we will sign in this user without needing to create a user in the database. To sign in a user, I think that we can simply store the uid in the local storage object. To access API resources, we will use this uid with every API request. I think that this is not that secure, but it will get the job done for us getting to the MVP that is required. We will need to create a technical debt ticket in order to make this approach more secure.}
