# Habits

Habits is a web application designed to help users quit bad habits. The application provides a straightforward interface where users can create a personalized list of habits they want to quit. Each day, users can mark their habits as complete or incomplete, allowing them to track their progress over time. The app features password protection to keep users' habit data private and secure.

The application is built using React for the frontend interface, Node.js for the backend API, and MongoDB for data storage, creating a responsive and reliable user experience. Whether you're trying to read more books, exercise regularly, or develop any other positive habit, this tool helps you stay accountable and monitor your progress.

### Developer Instructions
To run the app locally, cd into the api directory and do `netlify dev`, then in another terminal do `npm start` from the web directory. To deploy an API change, run `netlify deploy` to stage changes then do `netlify deploy --prod` once functionality has been verified.
